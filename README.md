# Vim Scripts
------------

I've just started learning vim, keeping track of what I'm doing with this repo.

### LaTeX ###

Two commands here. 

* `:Latex` - This one compiles and opens the pdf is compile is successful (assumes OSX, uses `open` command)
* `:Assignment` - If vim is used to create a new tex file, this command fills the file with my assignment template
